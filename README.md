# Rust GUI Libraries

This is a research document designed to help new Rust developers select a GUI library. 

Rust is performant and popular. However, the Rust ecosystem is young compared to other languages.
In particular, many Rust GUI libraries are unstable, under-documented, and early-development.
This table compares existing libraries based on these qualities:

 - Stability
 - Quality of Documentation
 - User-Friendliness
 - Performance
 - Activity of Community
